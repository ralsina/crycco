# crycco

Crycco is a crystal remix of [Docco](http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/)
a small, nice, literate programming tool.

But the best way to understand it is to see it working. Here is the
[Crycco documentation](https://ralsina.me/crycco/) which is ... the
Crycco source code processed by Crycco ðŸ¤£

## Installation

* Clone the repo
* `shards build`
* Take the `bin/crycco` binary and put it in your path

You don't need any other files or anything.

## Usage

```docopt
$ bin/crycco --help
Crycco, a Crystal version of docco/pycco/etc.

Usage:
    crycco FILE... [-L <file>][-l <name>][-o <path>][-c <file>]
                     [-t <file>] [--doc|--code]
    crycco -v
    cryco --help

Options:
  -v, --version           output the version number
  -l, --languages <file>  use a custom languages.yml file
  -o, --output <path>     output to a given folder [default: docs/]
  -t, --template <name>   template for doc layout [default: sidebyside]
  --code                  output source code instead of HTML [default: false]
  -h, --help              this help message

Crycco comes with two templates for HTML documents which you can
use in the -t option when generating docs:

sidebyside (default)
  Shows the docs and code in two columns, matching docs to the code
  they are about.
basic
  Single columns, docs then code, then docs then code.

If you use the --code option, the output will be machine-readable
source code instead of HTML.
```

It can also be used as a library but not documenting it here just in case
I want to change it soon. I will be integrating it with
[Nicolino](https://nicolino.ralsina.me) which should give me clarity on how
to use it.

## Development

It's a tiny program, you can understand it in 15 minutes. Go to
<https://crycco.ralsina.me/> and read the source code.
